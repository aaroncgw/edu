CSCI E-63C: Elements of Data Science and Statistical Learning with R
----
**Spring Term 2018**  
_Andrey Sivachenko, PhD, Victor A. Farutin, PhD_

_One of the broad goals of data science is examining raw data with the purpose of identifying its structure and trends, 
and of deriving conclusions and hypotheses from it. In the modern world awash with data, data analytics is more important 
than ever to fields ranging from biomedical research, space and weather science, finance, business operations and 
production, to marketing and social media applications. This course introduces various statistical learning methods and 
their applications. The R programming language, a very popular and powerful platform for scientific and statistical 
analysis and visualization, is introduced and used throughout the course. We discuss the fundamentals of statistical 
testing and learning, and cover topics of linear and non-linear regression, clustering and classification, support vector 
machines, and decision trees. The datasets used in the examples are drawn from diverse domains such as finance, genomics, 
and customer sales and survey data._


CSCI E-88: Principles of Big Data Processing
-----
**Fall Term 2017**  
_Marina Yu Popova_ 

_The goal of this course is to learn core principles of building highly distributed, highly available systems for 
processing large volumes of data with historical and near real-time querying capabilities. We cover the stages of data 
processing that are common to most real-world systems, including high-volume, high-speed data ingestion, historical and 
real-time metrics aggregation, unique counts, data de-duplication and reprocessing, storage options for different 
operations, and principles of distributed data indexing and search. We review approaches to solving common challenges 
of such systems and implement some of them. The focus of this course is on understanding the challenges and core principles 
of big data processing, not on specific frameworks or technologies used for implementation. We review a few notable 
technologies for each area with a deeper dive into a few select ones. The course is structured as a progression of topics 
covering the full, end-to-end data processing pipeline typical in real-world scenarios._

CSCI E-109A: Introduction to Data Science
-----
**Fall Term 2016**  
_Pavlos Protopapas, Weiwei Pan, Kevin A. Rader_  

_This course focuses on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine 
learning methods. Material covered integrates the five key facets of an investigation using data: data collection—data 
wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; data management—accessing data quickly and reliably; 
exploratory data analysis—generating hypotheses and building intuition; prediction or statistical learning; and 
communication — summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries._ 

Assignments covering visualization, simple and multiple linear regression, KNN, model regularization, PCA, Bayesian 
thinking, logistic regression, random forests, SVM

CSCI E-63: Big Data Analytics 
-----
**Spring Term 2016**  
_Zoran B. Djordjevic_  

_The recent explosion of social media and the computerization of every aspect of economic activity resulted in the 
creation of big data: mountains of mostly unstructured data in the form of web logs, videos, speech recordings, 
photographs, e-mails, and tweets. In a parallel development, computers kept getting ever more powerful and storage ever 
cheaper. Today, we have the ability to reliably and cheaply store huge volumes of data, efficiently analyze them, and 
extract business and socially relevant information. This course brings together several key information technologies 
used in manipulating, storing, and analyzing big data. We look at the basic tools for statistical analysis, R, and key 
methods used in machine learning. We review MapReduce techniques for parallel processing and Hadoop, an open source 
framework that allow us to cheaply and efficiently implement MapReduce on Internet scale problems. We touch on related 
tools that provide SQL-like access to unstructured data: Pig and Hive. We analyze so-called NoSQL storage solutions 
exemplified by HBase for their critical features: speed of reads and writes, data consistency, and ability to scale to 
extreme volumes. We examine memory resident databases and streaming technologies which allow analysis of data in real time. 
We work with the public cloud as unlimited resource for big data analytics. Students gain the ability to design highly 
scalable systems that can accept, store, and analyze large volumes of unstructured data in batch mode and/or real time. 
Acquired techniques could be profitably used in a variety of fields._

STAT E-100: Introduction to Quantitative Methods for the Social Sciences and Humanities
-----
**Fall Term 2015**  
_Ethan Fosse_  

_This course introduces the basic concepts of data analysis and statistical computing, both increasingly used in the 
social sciences and the humanities. The emphasis is on the practical application of quantitative reasoning, visualization, 
and data analysis. The goal is to provide students pragmatic tools for assessing statistical claims and conducting their 
own basic statistical analyses. Topics covered include basic descriptive measures, measures of association, sampling and 
sample size estimation, and simple linear regression. Assignments are based on real-world data and problems in a wide 
range of fields in the social sciences and humanities, including psychology, sociology, education, and public health._
